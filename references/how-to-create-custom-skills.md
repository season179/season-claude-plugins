How to create custom Skills
Updated this week
Custom Skills let you enhance Claude with specialized knowledge and workflows specific to your organization or personal work style. This article explains how to create, structure, and test your own Skills.

 

Skills can be as simple as a few lines of instructions or as complex as multi-file packages with executable code. The best Skills:

Solve a specific, repeatable task

Have clear instructions that Claude can follow

Include examples when helpful

Define when they should be used

Are focused on one workflow rather than trying to do everything

Creating a Skill.md File
Every Skill consists of a directory containing at minimum a Skill.md file, which is the core of the Skill. This file must start with a YAML frontmatter to hold name and description fields, which are required metadata. It can also contain additional metadata, instructions for Claude or reference files, executable scripts, or tools.

 

Required metadata fields
name: A human-friendly name for your Skill (64 characters maximum)

Example: Brand Guidelines

description: A clear description of what the Skill does and when to use it.

This is critical—Claude uses this to determine when to invoke your Skill (200 characters maximum).

Example: Apply Acme Corp brand guidelines to presentations and documents, including official colors, fonts, and logo usage.

Optional Metadata Fields
version: Track versions of your Skill as you iterate.

Example: 1.0.0

dependencies: Software packages required by your Skill.

Example: python>=3.8, pandas>=1.5.0

The metadata in the Skill.md file serves as the first level of a progressive disclosure system, providing just enough information for Claude to know when the Skill should be used without having to load all of the content.

 

Markdown Body
The Markdown body is the second level of detail after the metadata, so Claude will access this if needed after reading the metadata. Depending on your task, Claude can access the Skill.md file and use the Skill.

 

Example Skill.md
Brand Guidelines Skill

## Metadata
name: Brand Guidelines
description: Apply Acme Corp brand guidelines to all presentations and documents
version: 1.0.0

## Overview
This Skill provides Acme Corp's official brand guidelines for creating consistent, professional materials. When creating presentations, documents, or marketing materials, apply these standards to ensure all outputs match Acme's visual identity. Claude should reference these guidelines whenever creating external-facing materials or documents that represent Acme Corp.

## Brand Colors

Our official brand colors are:
- Primary: #FF6B35 (Coral)
- Secondary: #004E89 (Navy Blue)
- Accent: #F7B801 (Gold)
- Neutral: #2E2E2E (Charcoal)

## Typography

Headers: Montserrat Bold
Body text: Open Sans Regular
Size guidelines:
- H1: 32pt
- H2: 24pt
- Body: 11pt

## Logo Usage

Always use the full-color logo on light backgrounds. Use the white logo on dark backgrounds. Maintain minimum spacing of 0.5 inches around the logo.

## When to Apply

Apply these guidelines whenever creating:
- PowerPoint presentations
- Word documents for external sharing
- Marketing materials
- Reports for clients

## Resources

See the resources folder for logo files and font downloads.
 

Adding Resources
If you have too much information to add to a single Skill.md file (e.g., sections that only apply to specific scenarios), you can add more content by adding files within your Skill directory. For example, add a REFERENCE.md file containing supplemental and reference information to your Skill directory. Referencing it in Skill.md will help Claude decide if it needs to access that resource when executing the Skill.

 

Adding Scripts
For more advanced Skills, attach executable code files to Skill.md, allowing Claude to run code. For example, our document skills use the following programming languages and packages:

Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib)

JavaScript/Node.js

Packages to help with file editing

visualization tools

Note: Claude and Claude Code can install packages from standard repositories (Python PyPI, JavaScript npm) when loading Skills. It’s not possible to install additional packages at runtime with API Skills—all dependencies must be pre-installed in the container.

 

Packaging Your Skill
Once your Skill folder is complete:

Ensure the folder name matches your Skill's name

Create a ZIP file of the folder

The ZIP should contain the Skill folder as its root (not a subfolder)

Correct structure:

my-Skill.zip

  └── my-Skill/

      ├── Skill.md

      └── resources/

 

Incorrect structure:

my-Skill.zip

  └── (files directly in ZIP root)

 

Testing Your Skill
Before Uploading
1. Review your Skill.md for clarity

2. Check that the description accurately reflects when Claude should use the Skill

3. Verify all referenced files exist in the correct locations

4. Test with example prompts to ensure Claude invokes it appropriately

 

After Uploading to Claude
1. Enable the Skill in Settings > Capabilities.

2. Try several different prompts that should trigger it

3. Review Claude's thinking to confirm it's loading the Skill

4. Iterate on the description if Claude isn't using it when expected

 

Best Practices
Keep it focused: Create separate Skills for different workflows. Multiple focused Skills compose better than one large Skill.

 

Write clear descriptions: Claude uses descriptions to decide when to invoke your Skill. Be specific about when it applies.

 

Start simple: Begin with basic instructions in Markdown before adding complex scripts. You can always expand on the Skill later.

 

Use examples: Include example inputs and outputs in your Skill.md file to help Claude understand what success looks like.

 

Version your Skills: Track versions as you iterate. This helps when troubleshooting or rolling back changes.

 

Test incrementally: Test after each significant change rather than building a complex Skill all at once.

 

Skills can build on each other: While Skills can't explicitly reference other Skills, Claude can use multiple Skills together automatically. This composability is one of the most powerful parts of the Skills feature.

Security Considerations
Exercise caution when adding scripts to your Skill.md file.

Don't hardcode sensitive information (API keys, passwords).

Review any Skills you download before enabling them.

Use appropriate MCP connections for external service access.
